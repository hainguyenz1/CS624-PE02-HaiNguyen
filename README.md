Input
The mobile app accepts user input through a TextInput field where users can type in their favorite course (e.g., “CS624”). Additionally, the app statically includes image and text components as part of the display content. These inputs are either user-provided (TextInput) or predefined within the code.

Process
The app is built using a functional component written with an arrow function. React Native’s core components—such as ScrollView, Image, TextInput, Text, and View — structure and render the UI. Internal styling is applied using the StyleSheet.create() method. Upon rendering, the component lays out an image, input field, and three categorized course lists: Core Requirements, Depth of Study, and Capstone.

Output
The output is a visually structured, scrollable screen displaying an image, an input prompt, and three course categories with styled headers and course details. The layout is optimized for mobile devices, offering a clean and readable interface.
